Create the execution role that gives your function permission to access AWS resources.

To create an execution role

1. Open the roles page in the IAM console.
2. Choose Create role.
3. Create a role with the following properties.
    * Trusted entity – Lambda.
    * Role name – **lambda-apigateway-role**.
    * Permissions – Custom policy with permission to DynamoDB and CloudWatch Logs. This custom policy has the permissions that  the function needs to write data to DynamoDB and upload logs. 
    ```json
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1428341300017",
      "Action": [
        "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
        "dynamodb:GetItem",
        "dynamodb:PutItem",
        "dynamodb:Query",
        "dynamodb:Scan",
        "dynamodb:UpdateItem"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
    ]
    }
    ```

### Create Lambda Function

**To create the function**
1. Click "Create function" in AWS Lambda Console

2. Select "Author from scratch". Use name **LambdaFunctionOverHttps** , select **Python 3.7** as Runtime. Under Permissions, select "Use an existing role", and select **lambda-apigateway-role** that we created, from the drop down

3. Click "Create function"

4. Replace the boilerplate coding with the following code snippet and click "Save"

**Example Python Code**
```python
from __future__ import print_function

import boto3
import json

print('Loading function')


def lambda_handler(event, context):
    '''Provide an event that contains the following keys:

      - operation: one of the operations in the operations dict below
      - tableName: required for operations that interact with DynamoDB
      - payload: a parameter to pass to the operation being performed
    '''
    #print("Received event: " + json.dumps(event, indent=2))

    operation = event['operation']

    if 'tableName' in event:
        dynamo = boto3.resource('dynamodb').Table(event['tableName'])

    operations = {
        'create': lambda x: dynamo.put_item(**x),
        'read': lambda x: dynamo.get_item(**x),
        'update': lambda x: dynamo.update_item(**x),
        'delete': lambda x: dynamo.delete_item(**x),
        'list': lambda x: dynamo.scan(**x),
        'echo': lambda x: x,
        'ping': lambda x: 'pong'
    }

    if operation in operations:
        return operations[operation](event.get('payload'))
    else:
        raise ValueError('Unrecognized operation "{}"'.format(operation))
```


### Test Lambda Function

1. Click the arrow on "Select a test event" and click "Configure test events"


2. Paste the following JSON into the event. The field "operation" dictates what the lambda function will perform. In this case, it'd simply return the payload from input event as output. Click "Create" to save
```json
{
    "operation": "echo",
    "payload": {
        "somekey1": "somevalue1",
        "somekey2": "somevalue2"
    }
}
```
!

3. Click "Test", and it will execute the test event. You should see the output in the console


### Create DynamoDB Table

Create the DynamoDB table that the Lambda function uses.

**To create a DynamoDB table**

1. Open the DynamoDB console.
2. Choose Create table.
3. Create a table with the following settings.
   * Table name – lambda-apigateway
   * Primary key – id (string)
4. Choose Create.

### Create API

**To create the API**
1. Go to API Gateway console
2. Click Create API

3. Scroll down and select "Build" for REST API

4. Give the API name as "DynamoDBOperations", keep everything as is, click "Create API"

5. Each API is collection of resources and methods that are integrated with backend HTTP endpoints, Lambda functions, or other AWS services. 
Click "Actions", then click "Create Resource"

6. Input "DynamoDBManager" in the Resource Name, Resource Path will get populated. Click "Create Resource"
7. 
8. Let's create a POST Method for our API. With the "/dynamodbmanager" resource selected, Click "Actions" again and click "Create Method". 

8. Select "POST" from drop down , then click checkmark

9. The integration will come up automatically with "Lambda Function" option selected. Select "LambdaFunctionOverHttps" function that we created earlier. As you start typing the name, your function name will show up.Select and click "Save". A popup window will come up to add resource policy to the lambda to be invoked by this API. Click "Ok"


Our API-Lambda integration is done!

### Deploy the API

In this step, you deploy the API that you created to a stage called prod.

1. Click "Actions", select "Deploy API"

2. Now it is going to ask you about a stage. Select "[New Stage]" for "Deployment stage". Give "Prod" as "Stage name". Click "Deploy"

3. In the "Stages" screen, expand the stage "Prod", select "POST" method, and copy the "Invoke URL" from screen




### Running our solution

1. The Lambda function supports using the create operation to create an item in your DynamoDB table. To request this operation, use the following JSON:

```json
{
    "operation": "create",
    "tableName": "lambda-apigateway",
    "payload": {
        "Item": {
            "id": "1234ABCD",
            "number": 5
        }
    }
}
```



To get all the inserted items from the table, we can use the "list" operation of Lambda using the same API. Pass the following JSON to the API, and it will return all the items from the Dynamo table



```json
{
    "operation": "create",
    "tableName": "lambda-apigateway",
    "payload": {
        "Item": {
            "id": "1",
            "name": "Bob"
        }
    }
}
```
The following is a sample request payload for a DynamoDB read item operation:
```json
{
    "operation": "read",
    "tableName": "lambda-apigateway",
    "payload": {
        "Key": {
            "id": "1"
        }
    }
}
```
The above JSON will create record Bob and the Second JSON will read the value and return Bob.
